Extensible parser library


Purpose
=======

The purpose of this library is to provide a minimal toolkit for building
parsers.


Name
====

The name "bobzurunkl" is a phonetic spelling of the phrase "Bob's your uncle".
Within the context of this library, the phrase has a dual meaning:

  1)  From <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob's_your_uncle>, 2020-09-24:

      "Bob's your uncle" is a phrase commonly used in Ireland, United Kingdom
      and Commonwealth countries that means "and there it is" or "and there
      you have it". Typically, someone says it to conclude a set of simple
      instructions or when a result is reached. The meaning is similar to that
      of the French expression "et voil√†!" or the American "easy as pie" or
      "piece of cake".

      This sentiment is at the heart of what I intend to produce.

  2)  I viewed a presentation by Robert C. Martin - aka "Uncle Bob" - on
      "Clean Code". In a sincere effort to follow his wisdom, the code in this
      library will be entirely test-driven. Thus, whose uncle is this project?
      Why, Uncle Bob of course!

      Bob Martin's talk was part of an event hosted by Rabobank called
      "Coding a Better World Together". Here is a link to the playlist:

Contents
========

The bobzurunkl library - written in C - consists of opaque objects and
functions which operate on them. The objects are as follows.

  1)  BuuIterator

      This object scans sequential data in a string, file, or input stream
      in units of either 8, 16 or 32 bits (1, 2 or 4 bytes). It maintains a
      current position and provides access to the unit value at that position.

  2)  BuuStack

      This is a LIFO object which holds a dynamically allocated array of data
      with element size determined by the user. The stack is meant to be used
      to store state and/or iterator position, depending upon an application's
      needs.

  3)  BuuQueue

      This is similar to the BuuStack, except that it is a FIFO object.
      Typically, the queue is used for tokenization.

  4)  BuuTrie

      A trie is an object for containing a lexicon broken down into common
      substrings. Each leaf - a node with a key which is the ending of a
      defined string - has a non-null pointer to some user-defined data. While
      a hash table keyed with strings would serve the same purpose, I feel
      that a trie is appropriate for looking up sequential data.
